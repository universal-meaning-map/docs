# Interplanetary mind-map history
### `2015`

- Listening [Epicenter Bitcoin interview to Juan Benet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erB7i6Uc4DM), Xavi becomes aware of the idea of content-addressing. It blows his mind that there was a way to connect any piece of information with any other. 

### `2016`
- [Dani](https://armengol-altayo.com/202103150041) and Xavi start a remote interaction around the dynamics of digital information. Original conversations revolve around how computers could assist us better if privacy was guaranteed and information was not siloed, as we would be able to expose much more information to our "digital assistant". Originally we referred to the project as "Samantha" referencing the [artificial intelligence assistance in the movie Her(2013)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV01B5kVsC0)
- There is a constant ironic frustration in our conversations, where we feel overwhelmed by the complexity of information dynamics and limited by the existing tools in order to think about how new tools should be like

### `2017`

### `2018`
- Dani and Xavi move together and decide to formalize the project a little bit. The focus is a mix of research of previous initiatives and ideas of the early web combined with new crypto technologies and a strong intuition that serving particular minds should be the driving vector. The [old site](https://interplanetarymindmap.github.io/oldSite/) reflects part of the ideas of that time.

- As a result of October 1th 2017 censorship in Catalonia, Xavi co-founds [Vocdoni](https://github.com/vocdoni), a decentralized, censorship-resistant voting system.

- The [Mind-map prototype](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4D8xT_KNP8) materializes some of the early ideas behind.

### `2019`

- [Presentation of Interplanetary Mind Map at IPFS meetup](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4D8xT_KNP8)

- At [IPFS Camp 2019](https://camp.ipfs.io/) we host a deconf session around "decentralized personal knowledge graphs" and became to know many projects working on similar ideas. 

- As [Vocdoni](https://github.com/vocdoni) grows and requires more and more attention, Xavi halts its involvement with `Interplanetary mind-map` and conversations are just kept in the background.


### `2020`

- The rise of "note-taking" projects such as[ Roam Reasearch](https://roamresearch.com/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as well as methods such as [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) offer new perspectives around the organization of information were natural language has a lot more presence. In particular, we start emulating some of those constructs on top of [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) which allows us to start experimenting with much more complex forms of data.

### `2021`

- Early in the year [Vocdoni](https://github.com/vocdoni) is acquired by [ Aragon Association](https://aragon.org/aragon-association). Significant differences in perspective force the departure of Xavi from Vocdoni. Xavi goes back to put all his attention into `Interplanetary mind-map`

- The adoption of [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) combined with early understandings of `self-describing minformation` has become a powerful tool to think around complex information and it becomes the engine that powers the conceptual development of `Interplanetary mind-map`. A big chunk of the frustrations for dealing with complexity is faded away. The main ideas for how an intended system of information should be are somewhat clear and starting to fall into place.
- The development of `Pseudo Interplanetary mind-map` takes place in parallel to the conceptual development. Its goal is to be able to create a playground using note-taking repositories as a data source.

### `2022`

- The first version of `Pseudo Interplanetary mind-map` enables early experimentation around browsing and inline transclusions.
- [Github repositories and documentation](https://github.com/interplanetarymindmap) are updated to allow onboarding of new collaborators as well as to start looking for financial support for the project
